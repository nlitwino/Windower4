ScanZone:  
Scan Zone is an addon that will let you scan your current zone for any NPC, including mobs. This will make the server send your client an entity update packet, which it then reads for certain data and displays in the chat log, such as name, id, and position. 
  
Commands:  
scanzone scan 0x00 - scans the zone for the entity with the hex id 0x00.

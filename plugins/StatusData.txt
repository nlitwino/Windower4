//Place any user desired durations in this file.
//You can also change the display name if you like.
//For IDs, look in resources.xml or online.
//You can also use the "toggleextinfo" command in StatusTimer to see the IDs of your current buffs.
//Format:  <status name>,<status ID>,<default duration in seconds>,<alternate duration in seconds>
//If default duration is 0 (zero) or not given, time will always count up
//If default duration is -1, time will not be displayed
//If alternate duration is less than 1 or not given, it will be ignored
//Use two slashes (//) or a semi-colon (;) in front of the lines if you want them ignored

//Blink is included as a format demonstration, along with it needing an
//alternate duration value (300 = 5 min = Blink, 900 = 15 min = Aerial Armor)
